# Guess the Word Game (Python)

A simple command-line **Guess the Word** game built using **Python**, designed to practice core programming concepts during the learning phase.

## 📖 Overview
In this game, the player selects a difficulty level (**easy**, **medium**, or **hard**).  
Based on the chosen level, the program randomly selects a secret word.  
The player continues guessing until the correct word is found, receiving hints after each incorrect attempt.

This project emphasizes **logic building, control flow, and user interaction**, rather than advanced features.

## ⚙️ Features
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Random word selection
- Unlimited attempts
- Hint system showing correctly guessed character positions

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Standard Python Library (`random` module)

## ▶ How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
(Use python3 if required by your system)

🎯 Purpose
This project was created as part of my programming learning journey.
It reflects my understanding of beginner-level Python concepts such as:

Loops

Conditional statements

Lists

User input handling

Basic algorithmic thinking

📚 Learning Status
Beginner-level project

Built for practice and concept reinforcement

Future improvements may be added as my skills progress
